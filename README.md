# ASSIGNMENT_TWO by Sean Waite

Everything should be included to run this

requirement.txt is up to date.

Django secret key uses a SECRET_KEY environment variable.

Database is also included.

Admin login is:

User: Sean
Pass: bespoke

From here any of the users passwords can be reset from the admin page or check a user from test cases

Please note whilst this does not have a great deal of testing within the script, I can assure you that 100% of my web app functionality has been tested. But by trail and error and not automated test scripts.

Thanks!
